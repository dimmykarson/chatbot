## Introduction

This project serves as a starting point for creating a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT models. With this base, you can quickly deploy a chatbot that interacts with users, handles different queries, and can be tailored to specific tasks or industries.

## Features

- **Customizable Responses**: Easily modify how the chatbot responds to different types of input.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new features or integrate with other services with minimal effort.
- **API-Based Communication**: Utilizes the OpenAI API for natural language processing.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configure the chatbot through environment variables for security and flexibility.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dimmykarson/chatbot.git
cd chatbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
Before running the chatbot, you need to set up your OpenAI API key. You can do this by creating a .env file in the root directory of the project:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Alternatively, you can set the environment variable directly in your system.

## Running the Chatbot
Once everything is set up, you can run the chatbot with the following command:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

This will start the chatbot, which will be ready to handle user inputs and provide responses generated by the OpenAI API.

## Project Structure
The project directory is structured as follows:

```bash
├── chatbot.py               # Main script to run the chatbot
├── config.py                # Configuration settings
├── requirements.txt         # Python dependencies
├── README.md                # Project README file
└── .env                     # Environment variables for API keys and settings
chatbot.py: The main script that handles user input and interacts with the OpenAI API.
config.py: Contains configuration settings for the chatbot, such as API keys and response settings.
requirements.txt: A file listing the Python dependencies needed to run the chatbot.
README.md: The documentation file for the project.
.env: A file for securely storing environment variables like the OpenAI API key.
```

## Customization
Feel free to modify the chatbot to better suit your needs. Some customization ideas include:

Adding more sophisticated conversation handling, such as context retention.
Integrating the chatbot with other APIs or services (e.g., weather, news).
Creating custom response templates based on user input or intent recognition.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improving the chatbot or have identified issues, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
